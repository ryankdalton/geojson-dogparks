# geojson-dogparks
My wife and I recently took a trip to Canada and wanted to find a fenced-in dog park where we could let our puppy run free and wear himself out before the long drive home.  

Inspired  by cageyjames/GeoJSON-Ballparks, we thought it would be great to catalog great dog parks that people could visit while on vacation.
